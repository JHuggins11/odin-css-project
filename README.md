# odin-css-project
A landing page project for the CSS Foundations module of The Odin Project's Foundations course, based on a [given design](https://github.com/JHuggins11/odin-css-project/blob/main/desired-result.png) and making use of the skills and techniques I have learnt in the course so far, including HTML, CSS 
and flexbox.
